In this project I tried to implement a snake game using C. It was the term project of Level1/Term2.
I had to use igraphichs library (made by one of our university teacher). 
Tried my best to make it as good as possible. But in the end the game was not good enough to cut a good figure.
My supervisor didn't like it.
